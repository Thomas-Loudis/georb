% GEORB is a software for Precise Orbit Determination (POD) of Low Earth
% Orbiters (LEOs), gravity Field modelling, data analysis of satellite
% gravity missions and design of future space missions. 
% 
% GEORB current version supports the orbit determination and accelerometer
% calibration modelling of the missions:
% - Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission 
% - GRACE Follow-On mission  
%
% The source code has been written by Thomas since 2007. 
% GEORB was released as open source in 2022 and is available through the
% repository https://github.com/Thomas-Loudis/georb
